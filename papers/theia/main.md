abstract:
  Within the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), there is a need to evaluate tradespaces. 
  Tradespace datasets are the result of large parameter sweeps run over numerous 
  design options and can consist of thousands or even millions of design configurations 
  and the corresponding performance metrics. Because of the immense size of these 
  datasets, the ability to effectively visualize the data is essential for proper 
  evaluation. At the USACE Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC), an 
  easy-to-use plotting tool known as the Tradespace Holistic Exploration & 
  Insight Application (THEIA) has been developed for visualizing this complex 
  tradespace data related to the acquisitions process. THEIA was developed using 
  Python libraries including Panel, Param, Holoviews, Bokeh, and Plotly. When 
  combined, these libraries offer a wide range of widgets and plots that allow 
  the user to visualize their data in multiple ways. Additionally, users can 
  easily save plots, export findings, and utilize multiple data files at once. 
  THEIA is also capable of importing tabular data while presenting options to 
  customize visualizations and help the end-user make informed decisions.

### Background/Motivation 

Within the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) the evaluation of 
tradespaces has become an important capability. Tradespaces, in essence, are 
extensive datasets generated from broad parameter sweeps across a multitude of 
design options. These datasets can encompass thousands, if not millions of 
design configurations, each accompanied by its respective performance metrics. 
This process results in an immense amount of data, which, while rich in information, 
presents a challenge in terms of analysis and interpretation. Because of the 
colossal size of these datasets, the ability to visualize them effectively is 
not just beneficial, but essential for comprehensive evaluation. This visualization 
is particularly crucial when it come to the acquisitions process, where 
understanding the implications of each design choice can have far-reaching 
consequences. To address this need, the USACE Engineer Research & Development 
Center (ERDC) has developed a user-friendly plotting tool, named the Tradespace 
Holistic Exploration & Insight Application (THEIA). 

### Tradespaces - A simple example

:label: fig:tradespace
This is a simple example of a tradespace in the context of car shopping. When 
shopping for a new vehicle, buyers often compile a list of pros and cons based 
on certain vehicle types. The dataset the buyer creates is, in essence, a tradespace. 
For example, a buyer may want to maximize potential range, while minimizing vehicle 
cost. By analyzing this tradespace, the buyer would be able to see that opting for a 
sedan provides both the best price and the best potential range.

### Methods

THEIA’s primary function is to provide a means of visualizing intricate tradespace 
data, thereby facilitating a more thorough understanding of the various design 
configurations and their corresponding performance metrics. It's a robust 
tool built upon several Python libraries, including [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/), 
[Param](https://param.holoviz.org/), [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/), 
[Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/). The integration 
of these libraries equips THEIA with a diverse array of widgets and plots, enabling 
users to visualize their data in various ways simultaneously. Panel, Param, and 
HoloViews are all a part of the HoloViz suite of Python packages, which allows for 
excellent synchronization between them.

#### THEIA - Panel
Panel @panel is a library for easily building tools, dashboards, and complex applications, 
all within Python. It’s role in THEIA is to define the layout of the application, 
as seen above.

#### THEIA - Param
Param @param is a library built for handling user-modifiable parameters, arguments, and attributes 
that control your code. These capabilities are used in THEIA to monitor for user 
inputs and changes. This library is responsible for handling user inputs such as 
the plot type and color map options shown above.

#### THEIA - HoloViews/Bokeh
HoloViews @holoviews is a library built for data analysis and visualization with small amounts of code. This library is the backend that provides many of the plots in THEIA. Bokeh @bokeh is a library for creating visualizations in modern web browsers. Both the Panel and HoloViews libraries leverage Bokeh. Panel utilizes Bokeh for rendering the layout, while HoloViews uses Bokeh to render some of the plots.

#### THEIA - Plotly Parallel Plot
Plotly @plotly is a high-level API for creating figures. Plotly is utilized by HoloViews 
for rendering supplementary plots, such as the parallel plot seen above. 

### Results
Together, these scientific Python libraries allowed the Rapid Application Development team at ERDC to develop a 
robust visualization tool capable of running in the browser without being reliant 
on an internet connection. THEIA allows users to tailor the types of plots 
displayed, as well as adjust color themes. This is an important feature when 
working with tradespace data because it allows the user to choose the theme which 
best distinguishes the complex data. THEIA allows users to easily save plots for 
future reference, export findings for further analysis, and utilize multiple data 
files simultaneously. Another key feature THEIA provides is the ability to import 
tabular data. Ultimately, through the utilization of these scientific Python 
libraries, the USACE ERDC was able to develop a robust solution to the tradespace
visualization problem.
